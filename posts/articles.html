			<h1>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h1>
		<p> Open graph meta tags are technology used first by facebook to integerate between user's data and a webiste. Open graph allows to identify my website when I want 
		to share it on facebook, by declaring some certain information to appear as a logo anytime I share the webpage link. For instance, on facebook when i share my webpage link
		an image with website name, description and title will appear. I manage those simple details with using meta tags specified by facebook, and every othersocial media
		platforms has their own meta tags that could help the developer to design the sharing link logo.</p>

			<h1>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h1>
		<p> There are some reasons that shows the benfits of sperating html files from css stylesheets and I could spicfy them as follow:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Design wise: its easier to structure when we seperate the style, and that is an important reason. For developer editing and creating would be more 
		sufficient when file are seperated and well organized.</li>
		<li>Avoid code duplication: defining the elements and reuse them, helps avoiding two elements from sharing same style.</li>
		<li>Reduce bandwith usage.</li>
